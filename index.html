                <h3>Personality Type: </h3>
                <p>Campaigner</p>
                <img src="src/images/enfp-campaigner.svg" alt="campaigner">
                <p> Campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.</p>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <q>Campaigners are fiercely independent, and much more than stability and security, they crave creativity and freedom.</q>
                    <p>Life is an interconnected, complex puzzle.</p>
                    <p>Misreading people is definitely a potential pot-hole.</p>
                    <p>I explore my feelings and ideas before I solidify them.</p>

                    <h3>Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
                    <q>Curious – When it comes to new ideas, Campaigners aren’t interested in brooding – they want to go out and experience things, and don’t hesitate to step out of their comfort zones to do so.</br></q>
                    <q>It’s hard for Campaigners to maintain interest as tasks drift towards routine, administrative matters, and away from broader concepts.</q>
                    <p>Being hyper-aware has left my to be very observant. I'm a people watcher by trade.</p>
                    <p>My progress in life is often fueld by bursts of uncontrollable energy.</p>
                    <p>Administrative work is a bane to my existence, yet necesarry to be the scatter-branied person I am.</p>

                <section class="friendships right">
                    <h3>Friendships</h3>
                    <q>As with other relationships, Campaigners view their friendships as opportunities to experience another angle of the universe, and tend to imbue potential friendships with that weighty and idealistic quality.</q>
                    <p>I try to be as warm, understanding, and have an open-heart when I listen to my friends.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes my expectations can supercede the true state of reality with my friends. Some people just dont't have enough time to direct their full attention towards me</p>
                    <p>I can be sensitive. Harsh jokes may leave a bruise, even if I question why I let it bruise in the first place.</p>

                <section class="paths left">
                    <h3>Career Paths</h3>
                    <q>If there’s a challenge Campaigners face when selecting a career, it isn’t that they lack talent or options or drive, it’s that there are so many things out there that are just cool.</q>
                    <p>There are too many ideas and careers to explore. No single idea or path fits me.</p>
                    <p>I constantly question the status quo</p>
                    <p>Consulting is appealing to me. I need the ability to mesh my knowledge of everything together to create something interesting. Jack of all Trades, baby!</p>

                <section class="habits right">
                    <h3>Workplace Habits</h3>
                    <q>People with the Campaigner personality type are excellent listeners, able to analyze and understand others’ perspectives effortlessly.</q>
                    <p>I try and throw new ideas out to my bosses in order to improve or make something more efficient.</p>
                    <p>I expect my colleagues to be a lot like me, and if they aren't, I'm in the wrong place.</p>
                    <p>While I may be an understanding and open manager, that may be a flaw when it comes to laying down the law.</p>
